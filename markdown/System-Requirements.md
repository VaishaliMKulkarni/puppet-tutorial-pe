## Minimum System Requirements

* You will need the ability to install software on your workstation (Admin / Super-User privileges).  We will use the following software:
    - Git
    - VirtualBox
    - Vagrant or Docker

* The software we will use is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, so you should be able to use any platform.

* Disk space:
    - 2GB of free disk space to acomodate software and VM/Container images

* Memory:
    - minimum 8GB of RAM if using Docker Containers
    - minimum 12GB of RAM if using VirtualBox VMs

* Note: You will use either Vagrant to spin up VM's or Docker to spin up Containers
    - We will not use both (at the same time), so choose one or the other
    - Although Vagrant is capable of spinning up Docker containers, we will
      not use this capability
