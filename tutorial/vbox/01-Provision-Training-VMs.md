# **Lab #1** - Install software, and use Vagrant to deploy 3 training VMs

---

### Overview ###

Time to complete:  30 minutes

In the following lab you will install the following software:

1. **Git** (should already be installed) - the version control system
2. **VirtualBox** - the hypervisor used by default by Vagrant
3. **Vagrant** - the virtual machine deployment tool

...and then create 3 VirtualBox VMs named as follows:

1. **puppet**   (Puppet Master, PE Console, etc.)
3. **agent**    (A Puppet agent)
2. **gitlab**   (GitLab, which will also run the Puppet agent)

### Steps ###

* Download the needed software for this training...

```
[puppet-training-pe]$ cd share
[puppet-training-pe/share]$ cd software
[puppet-training-pe/share/software]$ ./download-all.sh
```

* Install VirtualBox
      - find the appropriate installer in `puppet-training-pe/share/software/virtualbox/5.0.14-105127`
      - Installers for Mac OS X and Windows are provided, but others can be downloaded as well
      - other installers available here: <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>

* OPTIONAL: Start VirtualBox and configure 'Default Machine Folder' to place VM's in a directory other than the default if you wish
      - (e.g. external HD with more space than your internal SSD)

* Install Vagrant
      - find the appropriate installer in `puppet-training-pe/share/software/vagrant`
      - others available here: <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>

* cd into puppet-training-pe and 'vagrant up puppet' to provision the VM

```
cd puppet-training-pe
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
vagrant up puppet
```

* once the 'puppet' VM is provisioned, get familiar with vagrant, and confirm the VM specs are correct:

```
    vagrant ssh puppet              # to verify that you are able to login (should not be prompted for password)
    cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep proc   # how many vCPU's does the VM have? (should see 4 processors)
    free -h                         # how much RAM is available on this VM? (should be 3.7GB or close to that)
    df -h /share                    # is our shared space mounted up? (should see 'share' filesystem mounted on /share)
    ls -al /share/software          # should see out puppet-enterprise directory in there
    exit                            # and drop out of VM, back to host OS shell prompt
```

When you're done working through any particular lab, and want to stop your
VM's, you'd issue a 'vagrant halt' command followed by the VM name, as follows:

```
    vagrant halt puppet        # and wait for VM to shutdown
```
If you issued a `vagrant halt puppet` to test the above, make sure you issue a `vagrant up puppet` before continuing on through the labs...

If all goes well with the above, we can be confident that our VM is working as expected, and let's move on.

Let's login to your puppet VM again with `vagrant ssh puppet`

You should see that /share is in `df` output, and this is your shared filesystem space that is also accessible outside of the VM

```
$ vagrant ssh puppet
Last login: Fri Oct 21 15:14:38 2016 from 10.0.2.2
[vagrant@puppet ~]$ df -h /share
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
none            223G  206G   18G  93% /share
```

If you copy a file to **/share** within your VM, you will be able to get to it from your host OS at **puppet-training-pe/share**
(and visa versa)


Get comfortable with Vagrant, and connecting to your VM.  The most useful commands you'll need are:

```
vagrant up <name>          # start the VM, and provision it if it's the first time
vagrant halt <name>        # shutdown the VM cleanly
vagrant global-status      # show the status of your VMs (powered on or off)
vagrant destroy <name>     # if you want to completely destroy your VM and start over
vagrant ssh <name>         # connect to your VM with ssh
vagrant ssh-config <name>  # show ssh config in case you want to use PuTTY to connect to your VM
```

You'll also need to provision 2 more VMs, one for GitLab, and one more which will run the
puppet agent.

```
vagrant up gitlab          # provision the VM for your GitLab server
vagrant up agent           # provision your VM that will be one of your puppet agents
```

Once you provision your **gitlab** and **agent** VMs, you should see them in the output of **vagrant global-status**

```
$ vagrant global-status
id       name         provider   state    directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4dd5ed7  puppet       virtualbox running  /Users/Mark/Vagrant/puppet-training-pe
070258c  gitlab       virtualbox running  /Users/Mark/Vagrant/puppet-training-pe
682eafe  agent        virtualbox running  /Users/Mark/Vagrant/puppet-training-pe

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```

This concludes Lab #1.  You should now have 3 VMs up and running named as shown above in the 'global-status' output above.

If you're curious how the VM's are configured, take a peek at the
[puppet-training-pe/Vagrantfile](/Vagrantfile)

If you're not planning to continue to the next lab, you may want to halt all
of your training VM's.  Make sure you've exited the ssh session of each VM,
and back down to the shell prompt on your workstation, then issue the **vagrant halt**
for each VM as follows:

```
vagrant halt puppet
vagrant halt agent
vagrant halt gitlab
```

Note:  Doing a **halt** will gracefully shutdown your VM, not simply power
it off.  You do **not** need to shutdown the OS running in the VM first.  If you
do that, the **vagrant halt** wont be able to shutdown gracefully, will
timeout trying, and then power off the VM.
